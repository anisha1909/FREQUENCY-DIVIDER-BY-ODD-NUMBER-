# FREQUENCY-DIVIDER-BY-ODD-NUMBER-
### Frequency Divider by an Odd Number: Basic Description

A **frequency divider by an odd number** reduces the frequency of an input clock signal by dividing it by an odd integer (\( N \)). The output signal alternates between HIGH and LOW states but has an uneven duty cycle because \( N \) is odd.

---

### Key Points:
1. **Input and Output**:
   - Input frequency: \( f_{\text{in}} \) (original clock).
   - Output frequency: \( f_{\text{out}} = f_{\text{in}} / N \).

2. **Odd Division Factor**:
   - \( N \) is an odd number (e.g., 3, 5, 7).

3. **Duty Cycle**:
   - The HIGH and LOW periods are not equal due to the odd division factor.

---

### Example:
For \( N = 3 \):
- Input frequency: 9 MHz.
- Output frequency: \( 9 \, \text{MHz} / 3 = 3 \, \text{MHz} \).
- Output waveform alternates with unequal HIGH and LOW times.

---

### Application:
- Used in clock generation circuits, timing adjustments, and communication systems.
